    <p align="justified">
        Chapters four to seven of the book "Twelve Pillars" written by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener are very much inspiring.
        I was able to see  how applying the principles listed in these chapters could benefit me in both my personal and
        professional life. <b>Chapter 4</b> speaks to achieving goals,it is necessary to have goals in order to be successful.
        There is power in writing down goals down,your mind will go to them and achieve them. Setting goals help you to
        accomplish them. Set mid-range, short-term and long term goals. Not all goals will be easy to achieve,but it can
        be done.<b>Chapter 5</b> references the proper use of time. One may regret not taking opportunities as they come.
        It is important to live well and do the thing that you love while you're still alive. Strive for your dreams, make
        the most of yours days while you have them. "Every day has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity."
        (Rohn and Widener, 2005).<b>Chapter 6</b> advises surrounding yourself with the best people. It is important to
        surround yourself with successful people and utilize skills and values. The people in your life may influence your
        destiny. It is important to assess the persons in our lives as well as the value they add, if any. Relationships
        bring either positive negative or neutral associations. It is important to carefully assess the persons we are
        associated with and look for relationships with persons who will push and challenge you. "Attitude is greatly shaped
        by influence and association" (Rohn and Widener, 2005). People's attitudes will rub off on you hence it is important to
        surround yourself with people who have positive attitudes such as winners and optimists.<b>Chapter 7</b> states
        that it is important to be a life-long learner. Life-long learners tend to be successful. "Formal education will
        make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune" (Rohn and Widener, 2005). Self education is crucial to
        success. Learning is the beginning of health and wealth. Read books as they are an excellent learning tool, learn
        from those who are successful.<br><br>

        This really speaks to me. The principles mentioned can be applied to my life  by:
        <ul>
            <li>Setting short, long and mid term goals and writing them down on a list.</li>
            <li>Making the most of all the opportunities that come my way.</li>
            <li>Making attempts to strive for my dreams while there is still life in my body</li>
            <li>Being mindful of the persons I surround myself with and only picking the best ones to be permanent members
            of my life as the persons in my life my greatly affect my destiny.</li>
            <li>Deciding to be a life-long learner and pursuing self-education.</li>
        </ul>
        Applying these principles in my life will be quite beneficial to my personal and professional development.
